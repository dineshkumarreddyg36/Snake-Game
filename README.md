# Snake-Game
This Project is similar to the snake game which is a very popular mobile application where when
you detect some food you have to redirect the snake to eat that food. If the snake hits any part of itâ€™s
body then the game gets over.
Created class and class methods to take care of different tasks in the game. One method for taking
the keyboard input from user, one to generate food, one to generate body such that it keeps track of
the head of the snake.
